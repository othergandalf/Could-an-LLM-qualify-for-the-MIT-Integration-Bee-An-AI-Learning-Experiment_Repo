# MIT Integration Bee LLM Experiment: Repository Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository associated with the paper:  
> **“Could an LLM Qualify for the MIT Integration Bee?”**  
by Max Gregg, Michigan State University

This repository contains:

1. **Data Files (CSVs)**
2. **Jupyter Notebooks**
3. **Figures, Plots, & Images**
4. **LaTeX Files & Integration Bee Materials**
5. **Textbooks / Reference PDFs**

Below is a breakdown of the directory structure and file groups.

---

## 1. Data Files (CSVs)

These files capture the AI-generated responses, assessments, and experimental results. Each CSV typically includes integrals, model responses, correctness labels, and grader outputs.

- **`random_25_samples.csv`, `models_prg.csv`**  

The random samples file is validation file for the Correct/NotCorrect autograder. See the end of 'Response_IDA.ipynb'.
---

## 2. Jupyter Notebooks

These IPython notebooks document the experimental workflow, prompt engineering, and analysis.

- **`Responses_3.5_Turbo.ipynb`, `Responses_4o_Aug5.ipynb`, `Responses_Assistant_4o_OptimizedBook_Aug8.ipynb`, `Responses_Opus_Aug7.ipynb`, etc.**  
  - *Scripts to query each model for its solution to various integrals and record results in CSV form.*  
- **`Responses_IDA.ipynb`**  
  - Data Analysis (IDA) notebook: graphs, confusion matrices, inspections, summarizing correctness rates, spot checks, etc.*  
- **`LaTeXfile.ipynb`  
  - *Constructive notebooks for generating LaTeX strings, exploring chat-based integrals, etc.*  


---

## 3. Figures, Plots, & Images

Visualization of results, confusion matrices, and other graphics used in the paper.

  - *Overall results tables, integrated data analysis figures.*  
- **`confusion_matrix_*.png`** (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude Opus)  
  - *Individual confusion matrices for each model.*  


---

## 4. LaTeX Files & Integration Bee Materials

Files that contain or generate the integrals used from MIT Integration Bee qualifier tests. Some are test PDFs; others are the official LaTeX sources or partial solutions.

- **`mit_solns_LaTeX.py`, `LaTeX File for API.sty`**  
  - *Python script(s) and `.tex` sources for generating integrals and solution sets.*
 
- Please see https://math.mit.edu/~yyao1/integrationbee.html for original material source. All LaTeX were adapted by the researcher.

---

## 5. Textbooks / Reference PDFs

- **`optimized_calculus_textbook_comprehensive_v2.pdf`**  
  - *A compressed or token-optimized version of Gilbert Strang’s *Calculus* used for certain GPT-4 “assistant” runs.*  
- **`mitres_18_001_f17_full_book.pdf`**  
  - *Possibly a reference or original textbook used in the experiment.*

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Reproduce Experiments**  
   - Check out the Jupyter notebooks (`Responses_*.ipynb`) to see how integral queries were sent to different LLMs.  
   - **Data** needed for these experiments are in the CSVs prefixed with `df_`.  
2. **Explore Integration Bee Materials**  
   - Look in the **LaTeX files** and **PDF tests** folders for year-by-year Bee questions/solutions.  
3. **Reference Figures**  
   - Visual results (plots, confusion matrices) are available as images or PDFs in the “Figures” folder.  
4. **Optimized Textbook**  
   - The file `optimized_calculus_textbook_comprehensive_v2.pdf` is the compressed resource used to reduce token cost for GPT-4’s reference.
